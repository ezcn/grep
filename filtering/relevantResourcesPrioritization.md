Genome Mining(GEMINI)69, 
seqr (see Further Information), 
Variant Association Tools70 
ANNOVAR49, 
for example, use
filtering approaches that prioritize variants only if they
follow a specified mode of inheritance, are predicted to
affect protein sequence or function and have a popula-
tion frequency below a specified threshold. 


By contrast,
tools such as 
VAAST and 
SKAT‐O use a probabilistic
approach that uses background population frequencies
to determine genotype frequencies and combines these
with mode of inheritance and penetrance to identify
damaged genes and disease-causing alleles using a bur-
den test. 


Some go even further: pVAAST67, for example,
can use multigenerational pedigrees of sequenced rela-
tives, following the segregation of every variant in the
family and correlating it with disease status. This results
in greater power for family-based studies.
