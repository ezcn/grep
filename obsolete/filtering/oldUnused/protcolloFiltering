#### Per/individual analysis 

List of per/individual variable position 
- COMPARED to hg38 (assuming healthy reference?)
- COMPARED to (Almost)all observed variable sites in humans (gnomeAD, 1000G, Bravo)Compile the most comprehensive list of variants and use it to call variants in the miscarriages samples 





1. Is it a new variant? --> look for high-confidence singletons/doubletons  
1.bis Is at already described but at low frequency?  

2. Is it in a stretch of homozygosis? --> evaluate RoH (no phased data required) if yes, it is a plus

3. Which are the functional consequences? --> pipeline for prediction 


###### ACTIONS 

1. make the  most comprehensive list of variants (MCLV) and allele frequencies 
- download data from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/variation/gvf/homo_sapiens/
source of data is (chr 13): 
22358556 dbSNP
    324 ESP
   4616 HGMD-PUBLIC
    138 PhenCode


- convert gvf to vcf to assist variant calling 
- calculate world allele frequencies (UKBB, gnomeAD, TOPmed, 1000G, SGDP, ESP,  etc...)

(ESP http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) 


2. make naive variant calling --> allelic state indicators at each position in the genome  
- freebayes 
- GATK haplotype caller 
- fermikit
- platipus 
- SV aberration signals
  - improper / discordant pairs 
  - bedtools coverage
  - softclip counts

3. INTERSECT for variants that are not in the MCLV 
(Virtually every genomic position needs to be scored, but we can start from some that looks special) 

4. Pipeline for prediction on 3.: 
# per-variant indicators
- VEP (genomic location, consequence, Sift, polyphen) 
 http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html
 
- CADD 
- ClinVar 
- pLI, pLOF, LOFTEE
- FunSeq
- NCBoost

# per-gene indicator [set of coordinates]
- - DDDgene set 
- - Essential genes  Wang et al. 2014; Blomen et al. 2015; Hart et al. 2015; goldini et al 2018

# popgen indicators
- negative selection: use ukbb as a population proxy to identify regions under negative selection
- ROH 

5. INTERSECT all indicators (possibly with weights) to identify variants
